I am a PhD student in the `Department of Computer Science` at `Purdue University`, fortunate to be advised by Drs. [Ming Yin](https://mingyin.org/) and [Rajiv Khanna](https://rjvak7.github.io/). 

I am broadly interested in `Human-Centered AI/ML`, drawing insights from not only machine learning but also human-computer interaction, behavioral sciences, crowdsourcing etc. My current research focus is on `Human-AI Interaction` and `eXplainable AI (XAI)`. Specifically, I am interested in building AI systems that complement human capabilities by design and exploring ways to enhance the practical utility of explainability techniques, ultimately aiming to elevate the performance of human-AI teams.

Before joining Purdue, I earned my undergraduate degree from `LUMS` and had the privilege of collaborating with researchers from [TUKL-NUST R&D Lab](https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/members/faisal_shafait.html), [University of Virginia](https://experience.mcintire.virginia.edu/faculty/ahmed-abbasi/) and [University of Notre Dame](https://mendoza.nd.edu/mendoza-directory/profile/ahmed-abbasi/). I also briefly wore a Data Scientist hat at [Afiniti](https://www.afiniti.com/), where I contributed to refining `Customer Experience Artificial Intelligence (CXAI)` by optimizing agent-caller `pairing` in call center-like environments.
