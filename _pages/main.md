I am a PhD student in the `Department of Computer Science` at `Purdue University`, where I have also completed my MS, and I am fortunate to be advised by Drs. [Ming Yin](https://mingyin.org/) and [Rajiv Khanna](https://rjvak7.github.io/). Along the way, I have had the opportunity to broaden my experience through internships at `Microsoft`. Before joining Purdue, I earned my undergraduate degree from `LUMS` in Pakistan, and had the privilege of collaborating with researchers from [TUKL-NUST R&D Lab](https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/members/faisal_shafait.html), [University of Virginia](https://experience.mcintire.virginia.edu/faculty/ahmed-abbasi/) and [University of Notre Dame](https://mendoza.nd.edu/mendoza-directory/profile/ahmed-abbasi/).

I am broadly interested in `human-centered AI/ML`, drawing insights from not only machine learning and optimization theory but also human-computer interaction and cognitive psychology, with an interdisciplinary agenda of enabling AI systems to become effective, trusted partners in complex human workflows. My current research focus is on advancing human-AI collaboration and eXplainable AI (XAI). Specifically, I investigate how *data asymmetries* (differences in informativeness and value across datasets) and *cognitive asymmetries* (heterogeneity in human expertise, confidence, and biases) can be systematically modeled and leveraged—instead of being treated as obstacles—to design adaptive and data-efficient AI systems that complement human strengths, foster trust and enhance decision-making.
